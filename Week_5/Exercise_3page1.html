            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed 
            on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects
             of website development rather than software development. Web 
             design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop 
             browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile 
             and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
